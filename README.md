This repo contains the files for the Course Project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera.

There is a run_analysis.R script that contains the code that cleans the raw data and produces the tidy data set. This tidy data set is then written on a txt file.

The descrition of the analysis along with a description of the resulting variables can be found in the CodeBook.md file.
